        This class implements a request buffering system that collects incoming molecular
        verifier queries and processes them in optimized batches to maximize throughput
        and reduce latency. It uses asyncio for non-blocking I/O and Ray for distributed
        computation of reward scores.

        The buffering strategy works as follows:

        1. Requests are added to an asyncio queue without blocking the caller
        2. A background task periodically flushes the queue or when it reaches max size
        3. Multiple queries are merged into a single batch with aligned completions/metadata
        4. Results are computed in parallel using Ray actors
        5. Results are grouped back to individual queries and returned asynchronously

        This approach provides several benefits:

        - Amortizes overhead across multiple requests
        - Allows Ray to optimize kernel launches on GPU
        - Reduces context switching and memory fragmentation

        Attributes:
            app (Any): FastAPI/Starlette application instance containing Ray actors in
                app.state.reward_model for distributed reward computation.

            buffer_time (float): Maximum time in seconds to buffer requests before
                processing. Trades off latency for batch efficiency. Setting this too high
                increases latency; too low reduces batch efficiency.
                Default: 1.0

            max_batch_size (int): Maximum number of queries to process in a single batch.
                Larger batches improve GPU utilization but increase per-request latency.
                Should be tuned based on GPU memory and target latency.
                Default: 1024

            server_mode (Literal["singleton", "batch"]): Server operation mode.

                - "singleton": Each query contains a single completion to score.
                - "batch": Each query can contain multiple completions to score.
                Default: "singleton"

            This class is thread-safe for asyncio but not for multi-threaded access.

        This is the core batch processing pipeline. It combines multiple queries

        Pipeline steps:

        1. **Merge inputs**: Concatenate all completions and metadata from all
           queries. Track which query each item came from using query_indices.

        3. **Compute scores**: Send merged batch to Ray actor via remote call.
           The actor returns BatchMolecularVerifierOutputModel with rewards and
           metadata for each completion.

        4. **Group by query**: Redistribute results back to original queries using
           query_indices. Each query gets back only its own results.

        5. **Aggregate metrics**: For each query, compute aggregate reward as the
           average of its individual rewards. Pack metadata into structured objects.
