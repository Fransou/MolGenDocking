"""Diversity-aware top-k evaluation metric for molecular generation.

This module implements a diversity-aware variant of the top-k metric that selects
molecules not only based on their scores but also on their chemical diversity.
It ensures selected molecules are sufficiently different from each other, preventing
the selection of similar redundant compounds.

    This function implements a greedy selection algorithm that selects molecules
    with the highest weights while ensuring each selected molecule is at distance
    (dissimilarity) of at least t from all previously selected molecules.

    Args:
        dist: Condensed distance matrix (1D array of upper triangle distances).
            This should be from scipy.spatial.distance.squareform or similar.
            Distance values should be in range [0, 1] where 0 = identical, 1 = completely different.
        weights: 1D array of weights/scores for each molecule. Higher weights are selected first.
            Must have length n where n*(n-1)/2 == len(dist).
        k: Maximum number of molecules to select.
        t: Minimum distance threshold. Selected molecules must be at distance >= t
            from each other (i.e., dissimilarity >= t).

    Returns:
        1D NumPy array of indices of selected molecules, sorted by weight (descending).
        Array may contain fewer than k elements if not enough molecules satisfy
        the distance constraint.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the distance matrix size doesn't match the weights array.

    Example:
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        from mol_gen_docking.evaluation.diversity_aware_top_k import div_aware_top_k_from_dist

        # 3 molecules: dist matrix has 3 pairwise distances

        print(f"Selected indices: {selected}")  # Molecules at distance >= 0.5
        ```

    Notes:
        - Uses a greedy algorithm: sorts by weight and selects molecules in order
        - Once a molecule is selected, it acts as a constraint for future selections
        - No backtracking: if a high-weight molecule can't be selected due to distance
          constraints, it's skipped (lower-weight candidates are checked next)

    """Calculate diversity-aware top-k metric for molecular generation.

    This function computes a diversity-aware top-k metric that selects up to k molecules
    with the highest scores, subject to the constraint that selected molecules must
    have chemical similarity below a threshold (i.e., dissimilarity above 1-t).
    This prevents selecting multiple similar molecules and encourages chemical diversity.

    Args:
        mols: List of molecules in one of three formats:
            - List of SMILES strings (str)
            - List of RDKit Mol objects (Chem.Mol)
            - 2D NumPy array representing a similarity matrix
        scores: Sequence of scores corresponding to each molecule (e.g., docking scores).
            Must have the same length as mols (unless mols is a similarity matrix).
        k: Maximum number of molecules to select.
        t: Similarity threshold (range 0.0 to 1.0). Selected molecules must have
            Tanimoto similarity < t to be considered diverse enough.
            Lower values enforce higher diversity.
        fingerprint_name: Name of the molecular fingerprint to use for similarity calculation.
            Only used when mols are SMILES or Mol objects. Default is "ecfp4-1024".
            See mol_gen_docking.evaluation.fingeprints_utils.fp_name_to_fn for options.

    Returns:
        Average score of the selected k diverse molecules. If fewer than k molecules
        are selected due to diversity constraints, unselected slots are padded with 0.0.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If mols and scores have different lengths, or if input types

            sim_matrix, scores, k=2, t=0.8
        )
        ```

    Notes:
        - The function converts similarity matrices to distance matrices (1 - similarity)
        - Higher t values (closer to 1.0) allow selection of more similar molecules
        - Lower t values enforce stricter diversity constraints
        - If a similarity matrix is provided directly, it should be a 2D NumPy array
          with diagonal elements equal to 1.0
        - Padding with 0.0 for unselected slots means diversity constraints can
          result in lower average scores than unconstrained top-k

    References:
        This metric is commonly used in molecular generation benchmarks to evaluate
        both quality and diversity of generated molecules (e.g., De Novo Generation task).
