The target molecule has the same benzene ring with a cyano group and a carboxyl group, which can be formed using the following reaction:\n   - Reaction: [Cl,Br,I][CH2:1][$(C=O),$(C#N),$(S=O),$([N+](=O)[O-]):2].O=[CH:3][c:4][c:5][OH:6]>>[*:2][c:1]1[c:3][c:4][c:5][O:6]1\n4. We can use the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (represented by the phenyl group in the target molecule) and a cyano group (already present in the target molecule) as the starting material and combine it with the carbon chain that has a methine group (CH) attached to a carboxyl group ([CH2] group connected to a C=O group) to form the target molecule.\n\nA + B -> C\n[O=c1ccc(C#N)cc1][OH] + [C:1][C:2](=[O:3])O[C:4](=[O:5])[NH:6][C:7][C:8](=[O:9])[OH,O-] -> CC(C)(C)C1CCC(CC(=O)O)(Oc2cc(C=N)cc(C=O)c2)CC1\n\nSummary:\nTo synthesize the target molecule, we can use a reaction that involves a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and a cyano group, and a carbon chain with a methine group attached to a carboxyl group.\n\n<answer>\nA + B -> C\n[O=c1ccc(C#N)cc1][OH] + [C:1][C:2](=[O:3])O[C:4](=[O:5])[NH:6][C:7][C:8](=[O:9])[OH,O-] -> 1.
