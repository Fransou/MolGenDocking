# Getting Started with the Reward Server

The Reward Server is a FastAPI application that evaluates molecular structures based on various scoring functions including docking, drug-likeness, and bioactivity predictions.

## Starting the Server

!!! note
    For GPU-accelerated docking, ensure AutoDock-GPU is installed (follow https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU for installation instructions).


Set required environment variables ([see here for all options](server_configuration.md)):

```bash
export DOCKING_ORACLE=autodock_gpu
export DATA_PATH=data
```

Start the server:

```bash
uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 mol_gen_docking.server:app
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
INFO:     Application startup complete
```

## Basic Usage

### Python Client

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/get_reward",
    json={
        "query": "<answer>CC(C)Cc1ccc(cc1)C(C)C(=O)O</answer>",
        "prompt": "[Textual prompt used to generate the molecule]",
        "metadata": [
             {
                 "properties": ["sample_654138_model_0", "CalcExactMolWt"],
                 "objectives": ["below", "below"],
                 "target": [-10.86, 197.27]
             }
        ]
    }
)
```
